## Hey there! 👋

I'm Chris, a design engineer based in Pittsburgh.

I design and build websites, graphics, and print media such as brochures, posters, etc.

My main tech stack is react, tailwind and framer motion. My favorite tools are canva, antigravity, and claude.

I've got a few pinned projects, but my favorite is [my agency website](https://www.mooneywebconsulting.com/).

I've been active as a freelancer in my community since 2020, but I'm just now deciding that building a github database is important. 😅

#### Fun Facts:
* I don't like coffee unless it's mostly cream and sugar.
* I love gaming and anime
* I have a Cowboy Bebop half-sleeve tattoo on my left arm.
* **Hobbies**: gaming, anime, podcasting, messing with AI tools
